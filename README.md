This project that is coded by me and my teammate in the extent of Machine Learning (CENG 480) course.

Online food delivery services rely on urban transportation to alleviate customers' burden of traveling in highly dense cities. The data related to Online food delivery services contains the traffic conditions (through the use of Google Maps API) and key performance indicators of online food delivery services (through the use of web scraping techniques to retrieve customer's ratings and the physical location of restaurants as provided by Facebook).

Task was to implement ML algorithms to build prediction models for classification of M5Class and M6Class attributes which were including in the data.
